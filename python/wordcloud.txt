Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/iamatotalpieceofshit) if you have any questions or concerns.*Twitter Stan's are toxic af , especially BTS Stan's...they r childishMan kpop stans sure are crazyAnd they were also saying LGBTQ+ people shouldn't exist and how being gay was bad. And I think they were making fun of lady gaga being sexually assaulted.Over a award that has jack shit to do with her.What the fuck is BTS, and why does it matter? It lost.As a BTS fan, this person just made me cringe. I understand being upset that they didn't win, I was upset too. But they went on live right after to assure their fans that it's okay and they will try harder. No need to attack Lady Gaga like that. Not to mention that it wasn't her fault she won.Lmfao what does her being white have to do with her being talented?It's scary to see how someone is losing their shit over a boy band losing a Grammy to someone more talented than them...They aren't even the one competing themselves? wtf even happens when you get a grammys anyway? isn't there always next year?This is why KPOP stans do not deserve to have any rights.Wonder why she has such a problem with Lady Gaga being white...It's a shame most K-pop fans (especially BTS fans) I've met are actually a lot like this. Not saying most are, just most I've met.What's a stan?Someone's gonna end up dating herWhat is the difference between "Stans" and "fans"?Imagine being completely incapacitated with rage just because the group you were rooting for lost.ngl, I was looking up Gaga's National Anthem performance and ended up with a post of her on stage exposing her bush and another exposing her behind...smh, reddit algorithm.A fucking rant just becuase BTS did not win a goddamn grammy. What a shitty loser, bitching over BTSI like kpop but there‚Äôs the chill fans then the crazies also someone play you need to calm down by Taylor swift to this crazie ladyOn behalf of my fellow bts stans; I‚Äôm sorry. This is gross.thoe BTS fans are going fucking crazy...See kids, this is why you don't go on the internet as soon as your feelings get hurt. You may end up embarrassing yourself, uttering threats, and generally coming off as a whiny, sore-loser twat. I hope BTS has lost a lot of fans for this childish tantrum. Show some class.The world is over flowing with mentally ill people like this - waaaah a band i like didnt get an award nobody gives a shit about, better make death threats to someone i'll never meet.  


Shes gonna have a tough fucking life.What did lady Gaga ever do?Dafuq is BTS....I‚Äôm assuming she is no lil monster ..?Twitter is so wholesome amirite?I CAN'T BREATH!This gets funnier and funnier as it progressesCrybabies on the internet are so annoyingMental illness is realllllllDeath threats, racism and homophobia, all in one. Yikes.this is literally the "talking to a brick wall" meme formatThe lady gaga fans vs BTS fans, truly the battle of the centuryLady Gag fans over BTS fans. ü§£Seriously? Does a cheesy, soppy, annoying, no talent band really think they were going to be more popular than one of the most popular artists in the entire fucking world?If you cant compete then don't.  I hate pop music and i refuse to watch bad pop music get taken over by WORSE pop music.Both bts and lady gaga have no taste in music , down vote me as you want its the truthDynamite is a trash song anywayImagine crying about a white women beating out a band of Korean femboys ü§£. This is why people can't take stans seriouslyThe mental illness in this country (assuming she‚Äôs American could be wrong tho) is extremely concerningThis is some trashy Gen Z shit.They both suck lol. Lady gaga makes bad music and so does BTS but at least ari got an awardDo people really care that much about grammys? Why care at all? Its not like you got one.Foreskin head guys lost okay! Get over it!Is anyone suprised that some intelectual tadpole would go on a butthurt rant on twitter about someone else than BTS winning some award and calling their opponent ,,white,,?

No? Nobody? Yeah I thought so.WTF is BTS? Serious question btwI didn't really care who won but damn if she won, it doesn't make bts bad because you can like multiple people, just accept the loss gracefully and move on.Who the fuck is btsYep, average twitterUm, wow. That's... I guess it's a younger person thing, but I can't imagine getting so bent up about an awards ceremony. 

I mean, I wouldn't even be upset if my *favorite* band lost a Grammy to someone else (probably wouldn't have even noticed, to be honest). *I* like them and that's enough for me.Feels sort of satisfying, I personally hate Lady Gaga, but it was great that she beat the ever living shit out of BTS.I dont know why people attack the winner instead of the grammy‚Äôs. This isn‚Äôt even lady gagas faultPeople like this genuinely are so obsessed that they create this fictional world in their head filled with entitlement and where their over obsession's is normal. They cannot separate fiction from reality and they need to go outside and look at the real problems of this world. Sorry for my rant stuff like this is ridiculous. Its okay to like your own music but this is unneeded. I don't listen to BTS and I don't know if their music is good or not but I do know those that enjoy some of the songs they make that aren't just genuine sociopaths.I love imagine dragons a hell of alot but you can't be personally connected to someone just because you listen to their music
Opinions are a thing that exist
Anything you like somebody hates
Who caresIt‚Äôs scary how some people can get so heated, upset and threatening over something like this. I‚Äôm worried about the Twitter OP.Now I‚Äôm 120% assured that deleting Twitter was the best thing I did for myself this yearDamn, giving hormonal teens access to have everything they do be displayed to everyone do be kinda embarassing tho don't it?She was so loud it tickled my heartWho TF even cares about who wins a damn grammy?"when i catch u ms lady gaga"When you accidentally get on twitter instead of the MW2 lobby.IDK if that was a real fan or just a troll, but I, as an ARMY, apologize on their behalf for the toxic behaviour they showed. That was very uncalled for. Neither the true ARMYs nor BTS is angry at the winners for getting the award.kpop stans are just cancerBTS stans are so toxic/u/savevideo, /u/downloadvideo

TXT being the voice of the youth... As usual...i'm sleep deprived so this is really hitting different lmaoFor anyone who wasn't aware, Big Hit announced they're holding a corporate briefing about their rebranding to HYBE (with the tagline "We Believe In Music" on March 19 at 11am KST  ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/m5mrcp/210315_big_hit_corporate_briefing_about_new/))

Why they made this video I'm not entirely sure but assuming it connects... somehow...Strangely enough, I got the exact same feeling from this that I get every time I watch a Hitchhiker MVNow I want a GFriend scifi concept. That cut from the dramatic close-ups to the awkward wide-shot was great! Was wondering what those outfits were for. Kinda bummed it was just a marketing video for HYBE. That's a fierce lookbighit is so dramatic sometimes, TXT's scenes give me [kbs dance practice room](https://youtu.be/lnCPwshObJg) vibes, where they wrote the script so I wouldn't be surprised if all they did the same thing hereThis was amazing. Big hit mansion when?Dhsksks txt believes in pineapple pizza supremacy lol the way they look so goddamn serious takes me out

Also can we talk about jimin with that doggo? Cuteness overloadtxt sure know how to make themselves memorableBang PD really said I will confuse y‚Äôall even moreThis video is weird as fuck but I will take it if it has all the BigHit Label groups in one video.no idea whats happening but nu'est as a korean the office skit was amazing and i would like more tbhI still don't understand what this is.txt believes in pineapple pizza!What the hell did I just watch and why was it so entertainingThis was so confusing, but omg this is such a great roster of artists!? 

That Aron touch was great. TXT and.. pineapple pizza? Hint for Chaos Chapter? :p Gfriend being futuristic queens.Been gone all day and this is the first thing I watched when I sat down. What a trip. Gave me the strangest feeling.

It has a 4th wall breaking, surrealist, multi-verse kinda vibe that reminded me of watching Wandavision. Especially when it got to the NU'EST smiley faces bit.

I suppose this is all building up the HYBE stuff and business expansion for BigHit, but wow... that was a lot. Lmao.on a different note pineapple pizza is delicious and i will stand by this statementStaff: "So, for the video one of you will be a giant".

Jimin: "My time to shine" \*smirks".

Staff: "Jungkook, come here".

Also, theorists from this groups must be like: "HOW DO WE FIT THIS IN THE CANON!?".everyone being all philosophical and stuff and then there's txt with their pineapple pizza with ghosting, of all songs, playing in the backgroundBig Hero 6 vibesWhatever the heck this is, it was hilarious - the cat with Mingyu (and the puppy with Jimin), the animated Horanghae!, paper toss being played in the recording booth, Enhypen being so randomly serious out of them all right from the start and I thought that was going to be the theme then Nu‚Äôest and TXT end up trolling us lol, and of course :) 

I wish Gfriend had been allowed to talk a little but sigh. They look incredible though! And go Huening Kai, live your pineapple pizza dreams! 

The absolute highlight was Nu‚Äôest cast in The Office, I‚Äôd watch a full season of thatYuju floating? Pineapple pizza? Giant Jungkook? Somehow I feel like I understand less after watching this hahaidk wtf is going on but txt showing up in this artsy ass video and having a pineapple pizza concept is so them lmfaoImagine they make something like this every year but with more interaction in the video.. Like a skit or something omg...... üòçüíñLmao this is so dramatic for a parent company to change their name.

\#IbelieveinEnhypencomebackü•¥When are you buddy? üòúI‚Äôm good as long as Jimin gets the petgiant jungkook isn't what i thought i wanted, but now it's a needI don‚Äôt really know what I watched.... but I believe in pineapple pizza üççTXT believes in pineapple pizza LMAO . They stand out even among their label matesI'm extremely disappointed with TXT, how dare they they support pineapple on pizza, and the audacity to advertise it so proudly?? 5 members in the group, and not one of them thought, "you know what this is pretty disgusting, maybe we should choose another topic that doesn't show how non existent our taste buds are" 

Also Taehyun looks so good with two toned hair I hope he keeps it for the rest of his lifetwo words...

GIANT JUNGKOOKwhy am i like.... very charmed with this videothis video is bonkers and i love itNever thought there would be a day where I see Nu'est in a The Office parody...

I want to have whatever the person who made TXT's talking pineapple clip was smoking hahaI‚Äôm genuinely confused as to what this is for but wow I loved every part of that. wow the production???

I have to full on stan TXT now for shouting out pineapple on pizza, their whole sequence is now my favourite thing ever&gt; I believe in :)

We all need some :) after that rocky start to 2021. Hwaiting!Call your big overarching conglomerate whatever weird shit you want Hitman, but don‚Äôt you dare take away the BigHit MV logoI have so many questionsI thought i already know the purpose of this video before watching it, but it is more confusing after watching this. Are they trolling, the heck is pineapple pizzaMy guess is that "Bighit Labels" is disappearing and then the umbrella group will be HYBE!I believe in ..... A THING CALLED LOVE di diddit dididi dida dit dit daaaajhhh 

*I believe in a thing called love.*

*Just listen to the rhythm of my heart*

*There's a chance we could make it now*

*We'll be rocking till the Sun goes down.*

*I believe in a thing called lovvvvvvvvvahhhhhhh.*

They asked for this to happen lolThe Aron mention made me tear upI AM SO CONFUSED WITH SEVENTEEN AND TRASH AND BTS WITHOUT SUGA


AND DON'T GET ME STARTED WITH THE CAKE AND PIZZAthat was really cool and all... but what was it, exactly? Aside from pineapple pizza, of courseI loved this, Gfriend looks so good. I do wonder why they were the only ones not to speak though.can anyone who‚Äôs well versed in this confirm if this is ‚Äòmagical realism‚Äô? 

personally i thought it had magic realism elements, such as magical/unnatural situations going on and nobody questioning it. also the fact that the story doesn‚Äôt lead anywhere, it has no clear motives and is almost frustrating to the viewers who are trying to understand what‚Äôs going on.

i‚Äôm so interested in magical realism but still not the best at spotting itc&amp;p my twt comment:

It's as if Big Hit hired Hitchhiker's creative director to create short Black Mirror vignettes for all the groups

also, I have no idea what this campaign is for lolim sure there is some philosophical meaning for pineapple pizza but i am drawing a total blank...ah txt...What the fuck is going on üò≠? All I understood from this is that HYBE is a pineapple pizzeria resort from the future.

I mean I'm not complaining though. The visuals and production are serving. And this is probably the closest we'll ever get to all the groups collabing.

Edit: I am now convinced their new gg is going to have a futuristic virtual reality concept with a strong emphasis on pineapple pizza.I like Jay kind of being the center of the Enhypen video. :) Jimin looks so cute, OMG, and why does Taehyung look so handsome? Also big lols at the pineapple pizza, but I can't complain, I like pineapple pizza. And who were the ones with the :) ? I found that cute.This was a really fun video.Why did Enhypen and bts swap though? like bts is really about teamwork and the meaning behind enhypen is literally about connection lol anyways #IBelieveInTeamwork #WeBelieveInEnhypenHAHAHA WHY IS JK SO BIG. Also am I the only one who doesn't get this video &gt;.&lt;omg i didn't know that svt was part of big hitIs The Office popular in Korea? I would have thought not but I could definitely be wrongtxt are so cuteMINGYU üò≠Well I learned something today lol

Had no idea Nu'est, Seventeen and Enhypen were all under BigHit üòÆFascinated by Seokjin's crooked fingerCampaign for what?Pineapple Pizza and Smiley faces are truly superior :)V was really trying to hypnotize me with that finger. Must... Resist...BH don't like girls so much they muted them /sI thought seventeen is pledis ent...Pineapple on pizza IS good üòåI BELIEVE IN MIYAWAKI SAKURAAAAThis clip really mix bag of their each personality..love itüëçsurprised nana isnt here considering she was in the dynamite video.This whole campaign thing is so weird to me. Why are they using their groups to push the name change this hard? At the end of the day, it's not like fans really care

Edit: I hope people aren't taking this as a dig to fans or any of the groups involved or anything, I really am baffled as to why bighit's going this hard for the name change lmao üò≠ Like, I've never seen this tactic before and as a fan of one of the groups involved it seems weird that they're trying to advertise this as a whole movement when it's just about branding. Am I really the only one wondering? Or is this actually a big deal?I really hope they swallow Source Music as a whole and introduce Gfriend as a part of the main label. Because that will create a big buzz for their new girl group if they are debuting in the main label not in a subsidiary company.Geez, with these guys, I find myself oscillating between "I miss them. Where have they been?" and "I'm overwhelmed, let me breathe!"**'BTS, THE BEST' Details**

**What is Film out?**

Film out is a new BTS song on the OST for the Japanese movie Signal. Until today, it had been teased in a trailer for the movie in February ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/lkksbe/210215_bts_film_out_in_trailer_for_signal/)) and was announced back in November ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/k0jbb1/201125_grammy_nominee_bts_will_be_doing_the_ost/)).

The song will be released at 12am JST/KST on April 2, 2021, the same day the Signal movie opens.

Also exciting, Jungkook is officially included in the credits on [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_SZ3ObGyTA) stylized as "JUNG KOOK" - I believe as a songwriter, based on previous discussions about his contribution to the melody.

&gt;Song Credits:  
&gt;  
&gt;Produced by back number, UTA for TinyVoice, Production  
&gt;  
&gt;(Iyori Shimizu from back number, JUNG KOOK)

**Wait, I thought Signal was a Korean drama?**

The original K-drama was first remade into a J-drama back in 2018, and this is a FILM remake in 2021. Not to make this more confusing, but BTS also had a song on the J-Drama OST called "Don't Leave Me" ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz6BUM4F2tY)) which is on the Face Yourself Japanese album. DLM was broadcast on March 16, 2018, and then officially released with FY on April 4, 2018.

**There's a Film out MV!?**

Yes! It'll release with the song on 12am JST/KST on April 2, 2021.

I don't think anyone expected a full BTS MV for Film Out ([new teaser discussion thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/md07ze/210326_bts_%EB%B0%A9%ED%83%84%EC%86%8C%EB%85%84%EB%8B%A8_film_out_official_teaser/)) nor was there one for DLM.

**The Big Hit intro is in this teaser!**

While I think everyone assumes/hopes the iconic opening isn't going to change, and while the building clearly is labeled HYBE, technically all the new corporate branding updates aren't official until a corporate meeting that takes place next week on March 30th ([more info in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/m1w4je/210310_big_hit_entertainment_official_name_change/)). Once we see the actual Film out MV I think we can breathe easy.

**Why is everyone talking about Bangtan Universe (BU)?**

While the teaser doesn't have the trademark "BU content certified by Big Hit Entertainment" language in the video description, it gives off *MAJOR* BU vibes and lots of parallels to [Fake Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C2z4GqqS5E), in particular. See [this twt](https://twitter.com/vminggukx/status/1375108089318273029?s=20) for a few particularly compelling scenes. IIRC, the last time a video or MV referenced BU was back in 2018 (excluding the BU game videos/clips) so it's been a hot minute.

**What is BU?**

[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/keekcd/delving_into_hyyhbu/) lists out resources and [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/ey7odp/how_would_u_summarize_bangtan_universe/) has a few brief summaries, if you want to get into it. Warning: it's a lot.

**What is BTS, THE BEST?**

No one had heard of it until this teaser/announcement!

Apparently, this is a Japanese compilation album with 23 songs that will be released on June 16, 2021. The [fanclub announcement](https://bts-official.jp/news/detail.php?nid=uEiuC4mXyPM=) (which is, of course, in Japanese) includes the full tracklist (Film out seems to be the only truly new song) and detailed prices and descriptions of the various packages and albums combinations - which include (some but not all): DVD/Blu-ray MV Making-ofs for their Japanese MVs, photobooks, a million photocards, etc. Someone mentioned that Japanese releases are often this complicated because J-fans buy a LOT of albums/merch, so there ~~will likely be~~ is a lovely chart or infographic explaining it for newbs like me ([link](https://twitter.com/nyannyanyoongi/status/1375215351592534024) \- thanks to spreadsheet ARMY!). I was also informed that Japanese contents don't tend to have ENG subtitles, so, three months to learn Japanese, whee!

See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/md091e/210326_btss_song_film_out_to_be_released/gs6fy8i/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from u/ashmute for more info on the preorders/release.

A few new photos have been released so far ([link](https://twitter.com/BTSPressData/status/1375181845814464515))([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/md7s4j/210326_abema_tv_bts_the_best_press_photos/)).

**Why a "Best" album?**

Apparently "Best of" albums are very popular in Japan and many use the word "best" in the title - hence, "BTS, The Best" (HT u/Calaxy_Stars and [this twt](https://twitter.com/BTSOriented/status/1375107165892059136?s=19))

**Why does BTS release Japanese albums, specifically?**

This is a pretty common practice in Kpop in general, and [this twt thread](https://twitter.com/tmikpop/status/1362783258400980995) from u/TMIKpop summarizes a K-media article that explains it really well.

Also, if you recall from the recent [IFPI Global Music report](https://www.ifpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GMR2021_STATE_OF_THE_INDUSTRY.pdf), Japan is still the #2 music market (page 6) and you'll see a few Japanese artists listed in the top 10 charts, though Japan's revenue fell 2% YoY (page 8). Kpop artists tend to build fanbases in Japan early in their careers and then they continue to invest/build those relationships too, like how BTS has toured there regularly.

**Is this like a full comeback?**

As [u/ashmute said](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangtan/comments/md091e/210326_btss_song_film_out_to_be_released/gs6gws5/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) it's more like a special release than a true comeback, so we'd expect the Film out MV release next week and probably some Japan-targeted performances and/or interviews related to the movie release and/or the album in the coming months. Last time, they did pretty limited press for Face Yourself but it was also a weird time for the group in 2018 ([more here](https://twitter.com/btbtbtsssssss_/status/1374736199324143623)).

**What does this mean for their Korean/normal comeback/mixtapes?**

Excluding Wake Up, based on more recent history, I would guess we're going to get a mixtape 1-2 months beforehand (aka April-May) and then the next album/release not long after THE BEST comes out.

* 2014: Wake Up was released 4 months after Dark &amp; Wild, and 3 months before RM (first mixtape)
* 2016: Youth was released 4 months after HYYH Young Forever and 1 month after Agust D (first mixtape), and 1 month before Wings
* 2018: Face Yourself was released 1 month after Hope World and 1 month before LY Tear
* 2020: MOTS Journey was released 2 months after D-2, 5 months after MOTS 7, and 4 months before BE (though 2020 was the COVID year so everything could have been impacted)

*Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Happy to take any questions you might have -- I'm not an expert, but I'm great at Google.*So Jin seriously just spent the night teasing us about his money and his close relationship with Bang PD... knowing that this was waiting for us at 00:00. Amazing.is this going to be a jpn album?So help me out, is this going to be like a regular comeback, or because it's a compilation it won't be as comebacky? I feel the adrenaline of comeback szn pumping through my veins, should I chill a little.This album title tho, just cutting to the chase and stating pure facts. üòÇüôåI'm trying to catch up and it's like a neverending well of content. I'm excited yet confused at the same time. @\_\_\_@

![gif](giphy|8lPSqcjcNjymIOS4Pm)I read the (poorly translated) press release right after a nap, only understood a couple of things and thought that "BTS, THE BEST" was just how they were referring to themselves, nodded understandingly and went back to sleep.If this album release is in June...then we are getting a new Korean album either in May or July? ü§î Isn't that their usual pattern?Wow I‚Äôm surprised BTS escaped a best of album for so long. All the j-pop artists I follow had several at this point in their careers. Haha. 
The 2 CD track list is on the link - it seems to be all their later Japanese version songs and Japanese original songs. Then there‚Äôs a DVD the music videos for 6 songs and making of for some of them plus Film Out and the jacket photo shoot. 

But there are 7 versions of the album! 3 first press editions, one regular edition, a BTS Japan fan club edition,  a universal music store edition and a Seven Net Edition. 

And you get special unique items at several stores.Hahaha are their album names an acrostic poem of BTS?

B - BE

T - The Best

S - ?????WAIT WHAT COMEBACKKKKKK SEASON UPON US

![gif](giphy|Gf3fU0qPtI6uk|downsized)WHATAs a photocard collector...üíÄ. Still excited but omg lolMy bday is the 16 - this will Be(TS), THE BEST bday in a minute..

sorryI think its a japanese exclusive releasei was just laughing at jin‚Äôs posts and now they drop this on us pls space out the new infoüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠Army was NOT ready for this surprise teaser drop! 
Big Hit have always manage to choke us and give us new breath of air to be excited at the same time--I don't want to get out of this relationship ü•¥

üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúOk sooooo... who‚Äôs buying all versions? ü§°I had a loooooong ass day at work yesterday. Came home, crashed, woke up at noon to find twitter in shreds. Classic.

April 2 isn't even that far out! ~~god how is it april already~~BTS really be giving me a new song for my birthday! I have high hopes that it'll be a hot bop that I jam to years from now as my new birthday song!OH MY GOSH WHAT IS THIS BIG HIT I WAS NOT PREPAREDThe whiplash. I feel completely blindsided but in a good way.Does any one know of any group orders for this pre-order that are US based??I‚Äôm not trying to start a debate or drama about whether or not BTS should even acknowledge the Grammys this year.  I apologize mods if this is not an appropriate question.  But... would a Korean group, singing Japanese... be a good album to submit under the ‚Äúworld‚Äù category?  I don‚Äôt know how the Grammys treats compilation albums, but this would include at least one new song, correct?  It definitely wouldn‚Äôt be fair to BTS to be placed in the ‚Äúworld‚Äù category because they happen to be from Korean.  But a Korean group, very popular worldwide, singing songs in Japanese, just seems very multi-cultural.

**EDIT:** ~~I rescind my question!  I looked up the world category, and I don‚Äôt think their Japanese album (or even a Korean album) would be eligible for the category.  *Daechwita* would have likely been the closest work by them (in this case a member), but that would have been only one song on the album that likely would have fit.  I still stand by~~ my original thought that it would be cool to be able to submit a Japanese album into a totally separate category,  while still submitting their Korean work to the more mainstream categories.  A Korean group, singing on a Japanese album, nominated in America just sounds worldly and multicultural, and be great if they could get recognized for yet another market that supports them.  ~~But alas, I guess that category doesn‚Äôt exist.~~ SORRY EVERYONE!!

**EDIT 2:**  And now I‚Äôm even more confused, because reading the [definition](https://www.grammy.com/sites/com/files/global_music_field.pdf) of the category from the Grammy website, I think BTS would qualify for the category.  When I first thought I was wrong, I thought I read the album needed traditional musical elements of  the culture it represented.  Like *Daechwita*.  But... I don‚Äôt think the definition on the website mentions that.My wallet is READY üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏BTS IS COMING BACK?!?!?!?!?!!![deleted]It‚Äôs giving me Fake Love vibesSo a compilation of all their Japanese songs with some inclusions? Wow. Right after Festa! So...new Korean album later in the summer/early fall then??I read in a YouTube comment that there will be 23 songs, is that right? I haven't seen that anywhere else or did I miss it somehow in my reading?Awesome love their Japanese albumsI AM NOT READY!!!!!!!!
I need oxygen I JUST SAW JIN AT THE END AND I AM LOSING MY SANITY!!!!!!!
I have questions 
Is it just a compilation or a full album?? 
and I thought that Film Out was that song for the Japanese movie 
üòµüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµThe release date is two days before my birthday, yay!

 Is there something I can expect for that week besides getting one year older, like promotions, performances, tv appearances?Well this is exciting! Im trying to not get too excited ~~since it‚Äôs a ways off still but it‚Äôs nice to know we‚Äôll be getting a new song and MV.~~
Wait!? New music video April 2nd! üòúExcited as hell. And wow, the preorder period is long lmao.The amount of whiplash I went through in a period of an hour...The name of the album... Why does it sound... like it's the last??? Or am I too... dumb?!

Edit: are they going to stop JP releases?!

Edit 2: i should resume my English lessons üòûüòûüòûFor every event, they should do a standard faceoff poster that promotes the event to more casual fans and then ones like this that are more artistic. This is greatBT continue to make the best MMA promo material.They should copy the breast feeding one and use Aljamain Sterling sucking on Justin Willie's big tiddies.Such great design.Man, BT Sport makes some cool ass stuff.Say what you want about BT as a company but their ufc social media and promotion team is unbelievablePride neva die!!!Pride was and always will be better lolHow beast is crocop?  DamnDamn! That pride Gp 2004 poster is sick!!! Are reprints sold anywhere?!??!That is so gangster fucking miss pride man they need to add pride mode to ufc 4That is so fucking cool.

We were walking up so early to watch those Japanese fights. Total adrenaline rush.Ahead of their time, PRIDE FCYou can tell there‚Äôs a lot of people behind BT sport that really appreciate the sport of MMA; a lot of great content comes out of there. Plus, now they have Bisping in their commentary/analysis team. Great work by them.BT Sport seem to have the right people in right jobsImagine Francis fighting under Pride rules the man would legitimately kick someone's head into the crowdthis poster showcases how trash ufc gloves are compared to prideBig shout-out to Dan, Adam, Nick and now Bisping for delivery top quality content week on week.This is fucking amazingI don't know why but I get Playstation 1 vibes with the Ngannou picture. Beautiful champ.Cro Cop P4P best quads in all of combat sports.i really really like this ideaAre these available to buy?This is fucking amazing. RIP to the coolest era of MMA.If you need to get a better view of the pitch then you're not getting the full experience.The Stipe one would look a lot better without his name in huge letters on the sides.The Francis poster is doo doo hahaha Why can‚Äôt people even seem to be able to *copy* Pride stuff right? Pride marketing was among the best in any field and at any time in history. Absolutely beautiful stuff.Pride never dies!Those old pride posters were fucking beautifulI have an OG pride cro cop poster in my office! I really want the Stipe one now, damn. Guess I'll have a print made or something.BT sports is one another level regarding posters, trailers and interviewsMan I seriously wish you could buy these sort of posters, shit looks timeless.Man I fucking miss prideFCThis is fricken awesome, love it.Why is BT sport better at marketing the UFC than the UFC is?BT does MMA so much better than any other network. You can just tell they actually trySo cool. Stipe trained with Cro Cop for a little bit back in the dayWhy does BT sport always have the best stuff? Someone there has real passion for the sport.The pride one is way better but this is still sick.Nooo nooo nooo. Bottom CroCop got knoked out by randleman. As a Mioƒçiƒá fan i am pretty scared of the fight.I don't know anything about MMA, I'm from /all. But the guy on the bottom left looks like he's wearing thigh high socks. Cute.Azaitar has Greg hardy levels of cardioExpectation  vs reality.

The BT one is like a child learning photoshop. Way too much going on and ugly background.This is dope.Really like thisNgl I think BT is getting a little too much credit for copying a poster here.Bt sport always has dope media stuffThese are quality posters. Top stuffThat‚Äôs so god damn coolBT Sport visuals and marketing is always on pointThis is fucking awesomeThis is how you end up in the relegation zone.So coolAnybody know if you can buy these?Way better than typical fight posters. Love this kind of stuffNow that I see the reference, the Pride poster looks much cooler.This is really bad ass. I would buy all of these and hang them on my wallWhere‚Äôd they post that?Pide absolutely slappedLove thisPride never die.Beautiful, champAlthough I fucking despise bt sometime, this is fucking dope. Nothing but props.It's a real shame that we have to wait another year for them to show the second division games.It's actually surprising how slim stipe is for heavyweight and as good as he is.The DREAM posters were awesome.I geek out over anything PRIDE FC relatedThat Pride GP poster is one of my favorite of all timeBT sports really killing it with mma related stuffNice.This is my sacred pledge, if I ever some how become a rich billionaire I will resurrect pride. Juiced as fuck, soccer kicks and open weight classes. Just the way it should beNever got too enjoy the pride days but I bet there were something else manthis is beautiful champ."I have lost the fish :("Nice"Cooper, there are many hostiles coming from the trees."

It looks so prettyReady to choose between 4k belgian waffles and pancakes.I really hope this gets a physical releaseChloe and Max kissing in 4K ü§§I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs not the same soundtrack for LiS 1..can anyone confirm? I would seriously be disappointed if they couldn‚Äôt include the same soundtrack againHell(a) yes... will it be a free or discount upgrade from previous lisI can only ejaculate so much in one dayThey look sooo good, can‚Äôt wait!Hope I can find the artwork of this just by itself cause it'd make for a really nice backgroundDoes this release after LiS3?What do you guys think of Max's new facial features? She looks a little bit differentIdc about lis3 but this has got me pumped up!!! Definitely can't wait to cry in 4kI‚Äôm super excited for this! My second favorite game of all time!Does somebody knows the name of the trailers song???Knowing more LiS games are coming does make me happy, but I'm not sure that games getting remastered within 6 years is a good thing. I hope we get some content or something for season 1.Does anyone know if people who already own the games get a free update with the improved visuals?Looks amazing, i have actually never played LIS. I just saw the playthroughs of it when  I was little. Mostly watching Jacksepticeye lol. 

But lately i've been thinking to get the game, and now there's going to be a remaster? Yeah, i'm definitely getting it now.is it just me or does chloe look a LOT like ashley johnson here?yesssss comes on the consoles for buying the ultimate edition. &lt;3YEEES. This is exactly what I've been hoping for.I could weep I'm so happyPerfect excuse to finally play Before the StormHella remastered.This my friend, this, take this damn rewardready to thrashWait what?!? What will be remastered in the games? Are we talking graphics?Hell yeahis this real??? PLEASE SAY ITS REALBut is dontnod the one making the remaster or decknine?I wonder which remastered version should be played first. LIS1 and then BTS, or goes in the chronological order in terms of time.I love this cover art so much!!I can't believe it.I'm so happy that we can have this.gon cry now brbThis is hella niceThat trailer got me feeling things I haven't felt in a long time, gat dangI love how the crows and butterflies crosses each other in the trailer. It really symbolizes Max and Chloe and the first 2 games.VR support whenIkrrr. Ok, true colors, cool, but the remaster just hits different ‚ù§I just know this, what is remaster, better graphic?I don't really see a reason why remaster it, but I'm hella excited. Take my money.I hope they use the original soundtrack, because it was perfect. Not using it would be a fatal choice on their part.I'm just curious, I love the games as much as the next, but why spend more money on a remaster? I am happy it's happening, but I don't think i'll be buying it, if I wanted to play agian i'll just play the originals, maybe just me. Excited for the new game though!BtS remastered would be even more amazing if it meant all of Chloe's dialog being redone by Ashly BurchHella yea the only good thingI'm i the only one who thing that they should make the remaster 4 owners of the original for free like bethesda with skyrim?I'm wondering how much of a remaster this is gonna be. The original had graphics and an art style that worked, so how much is that gonna change, and beyond that what else is there to remaster?I don't think the True Colors looks that much better than the original games so I wonder what Remastered is gonna look like.freckles are outHopefully they make the Frank confrontation near the end of BTS not as pathetically anti-climatic; holy shit. It'd be great if they re-recorded the lines, too; or at least gave the optionI wonder how they revamped the games with facial motion capture. I don't think they even collected that data the first time around, so would they have to like...go back and have actors mime the original voice lines?That‚Äôs nice, but I would‚Äôve also liked LiS2 in this as well. I mean, you can‚Äôt even get the full game on disc.will the people that already have them get it as an update??Now I can get my heart broken in HD :DI makes me sad because a few months ago when True Colors was leaked, there was also a leak about the development of a Life is Strange game focusing on Max and Chloe, I guess this was itIf the upgrade is significant I'll give LIS another go, but will avoid BTS with all my might.Do you mind sharing the build?Always excited when you post an edit. Absolutely love your videos mate, this is the high quality content this sub needs more of.you have good aiming too that helpsI love this new music genre....Some synth, bass, drums and the action cycle of a good ol' AK.

TarkovwaveHere's a link to more sweet tunes by TEUKKA!  


[https://soundcloud.com/smoukajoint](https://soundcloud.com/smoukajoint)What is that recoil?That recoil control.Bt? No thanks. No living or dead thing has ever betrayed me as much as 5.45x39 bt. May it forever burn in hell.My BT is never this effective :( I come out of raid it‚Äôs like ‚Äú12 hits - 98 damage‚Äù and I got head eyes by PSTThe problem with fun build is...they become your main build after realizing shits lit and can kill anythingMe: I must really suck.. my recoil control is way worse than this.

Also me: Reading comments about everyone else's recoil issues brings me comfort.Pretty good edit :) Do you have any other stuff?Good footage, great editing and even better music. Thumbs up my d00de.545 BT is the only reason I played the game. Adequate yet so cheep that anyone at any skill level can use it and have a good time.I was literally just thinking about doing this since the 95 round mags are cheaper than the 60's. Good postThe more rounds you shoot the less aim it takesWhat were you running for armor?Tarkov community: We hate CoD style gameplay recoil

lolNice work, bitchyour editing skills are amazing, good work!Putting on Killas Gear has an added effect :)That's what I did with this clip. XD scav boss got a nice taste of it https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/lrtiry/the_biggest_holyf_moment_ive_ever_had/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=shareBro at 31 seconds you prefire the fuck out of that guy. wtf?I've been using this build for a while. Really effective, and nobody ever picks it up since it looks like shit.Tarkov Typewriter.Unexpected Norm Macdonald @ 0:42 lolthanks to you i always shoot light while extractingA while ago I found someone in factory had mildly upgraded that one scav ak with the 75 round drum, and just loaded it with t45 I ran it for a couple games and it was pretty fun lmaoAccuracy by volumeSaw this yesterday. I came back to say that I blame you for my death, just ran in to a squad on customs doing this same stupid thing. Was raining and foggy so couldn't see where which bush they were hiding in and I couldn't hear over the cacophony of 95 round drums going off.Man, this was ace. Absolute masterclass in editing!Watching this video is amazing, its like your playing a completely different game to me. 

People actually dying when you shoot at them, people moving in straight lines instead of teleporting around the place.

What sacrifices did you have to make to have an actual playable version of the game?Honestly, the recoil on that thing must be rather high in comparison to 5.56 modded weapons. You must have really good recoil control yourself. Not sure if this is something everyone can replicate.Would you like to share your postfx settings?Another good one, nice work!Nice vidThis is glorious!I do the same shit sometimes, whenever I get a scav with the 7.62 drum mags I run the ak stock and just dump rounds at the enemies, usually ends up with me getting head/eyes‚ÄôdHyysh.. dont let people know the power of the glorious ak.. I like them being sub 30k. XDHow do you get that really nice b rollHey dude I love the content don't suppose you got a youtube channel keep up the great workBT never works when I use it lolI've been using this for ages lol. So many battles I survive just due to me being able to keep firing while they reloadDont know what was most epic, The music or the gun haha nice vid :)I agreeI always look forward to these videos and the content is always gold. Very therapeutic compared the actual anxiety I experience in-raid. Welp, time for me to go live in fear until the last 10mins of a raid.Does it come with good aim?Putting in that AK work.  Let's go!Holy shit that looks fun. I have so much crap sat in my inventory im tempted to just use everything I have or die trying then do stuff like this when i have room. 

This was really coolDAKKA DAKKA DAKKAFUCKING NICE EDIT!Fucking amazing footage and edit!95 round RPK drums,
75 round Molot drums,
100 round M4A1 bars,
20 round Sok drums,
71 round PPSH circles,
84 round PM circles,

Pick any of the above, buy one, and just use that single mag for a raid. It is fun as hell and reasonably affordable.A quick edit? Can't imagent what a fully edited video you could do! Amazing content!! Keep it up.How did you record the scenic part at 25-28 seconds?Oh you mean a pyro build? W+M1I‚Äôm thinkin I like thisThe MW2 montage vibes are strong with this one&gt; hold mouse 1 to win....

*watches vid*

Conclude: it also helps nailing them in the head.Man that was a sick edit with a banger of a soundtrack. I enjoyed that!Recoil is fine btwSick editI do the drum mag and BT, but with an RPK.Smooth editing mixed with dope music, couldn‚Äôt ask for much moreDovetail OKP master race fuck yeah.song?I LOVE THISAlways really like your vids! Nice work!‚ÄúGloriously powerful‚Äù

Laughs in no disclaimerThis is a pure beauty.I like the part where you gave them the middle finger while they were already dead.u/savevideoflipping everyone off feels so juvenileThat was really good editing, holy shit man... do you have a YouTube that you do this kind of video often on?Used to do that a bit early wipe, it is indeed quite fun and effective. Your ammo might not be the best in the world but if you can hold LMB for 1 minute, everyone ends up dead. 

Only problem is if you get killed first...I can‚Äôt control recoil in this game. I lose a lot of pvp fights because I miss my shots, or because im using single fireNice editing.How did you get those cinematic shots of the maps?u/casualteukka did you add the honky bitch quote yourself? very funny didnt expect to hear that hereFun, awesome music and awesome edit! GJ mate üëçWhat kind of armour do you rock? I always seem to get outgunned with BT but I wear level 4 armour and level 3 helmets.Oh my god it works. Bring this into factory, slap an Altyn on, and the loot is yours.I always find i run out of ammo too soon. Defo try this. Mayhe itll make me better lol.What‚Äôs the scope that has laser built I can‚Äôt rememberJust buy an RPK...Very well edited !Sounds like a cold Tuesday on a June, on the beach, during 1944.I just got this game... sho... should I return it?the edit of this video is on pointI like the part at 0:11tf is your recoil control skill
