fun fact : every second in this mv can be a wallpaper

Best song of 2020<br /><br /><br />Our kings are really legends

DYNAMITE TO 1B LEZGOOOOO ARMYSSSS

imagine taking time out of your day to spam comments on the video of a group you supposedly &quot;hate.&quot; shouldn&#39;t you be focusing on the people you stan? you guys are the reason they&#39;re not doing as well as bts

I&#39;m literally searching this in google now,<br />&quot;How to teach common sense to the haters and spammers&quot; smh

<b>Let&#39;s just take a moment to thank our dear lovely haters and spammers who fail to acknowledge that they are gifting us views.</b>

Stop engaging or replying to those attention seeker scoundrels. Instead stream hard. We get hyped and everything at start but gradually slow down just because of others. Stream harder instead of complaining.<br />:<br />:<br />I am damn sure our boys must have been very sad about the fact that their comeback ON didn&#39;t get a stage performance  in front of fans, even the members admitted they have cried about it and are frustrated and angry that the thing they worked really hard on didn&#39;t get what it deserved, in a recent interview the boys revealed that they work 18 hours a day. And also when this released and in one of the interview they were revealed that this mv crossed 50m in 8hrs they were very overjoyed and surprised and happy, definitely they got aware about the record of 24h but thats not the only thing lets make it more for our boys, lets make it to 300m atleast till JK&#39;s birthday as a gift making this mv fastest to do so, and till NJ&#39;s birthday let&#39;s aim higher and make it possible to give a gift to him too. By this we can make 1B in minimum number of days making the fastest mv to do so and setting a new record. Let&#39;s do it for our boys happiness and not for competitions. Lets pay them back the efforts, the tears and sweat they spent in quarantine. Please spread thiss. I am sure armies can make it if we treat this mv like it has dropped today and stream hard like a new mv at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg&amp;t=00m00s">00:00</a> an KST everyday.

<b>I&#39;m proud of you, BTS. With or without a GRAMMY, just keep doing what you guys do best, you living legends!</b> 💜

<b>Why I smell like someone is burning from BTS&#39;s success</b><br /><br /><br /><br />I mean to say haters so please don&#39;t create fanwar and  thank you for likes and reply. Keep $treaming dynamite 보라해.

Thank you for all of your hard work !!! The music video and the song is amazing, i love it so so much. During this hard times, your music and everything makes all the armys smile and  happy. I cant but was crying by the end of the MV, but it were the tears of happiness, the decision to stan BTS was the greatest i&#39;ve made during quarantine.  THANK YOU for everything. Borahae

Joon<br />Jin<br />Yoon<br />Hoseok<br />Mochi<br />Taetae<br />Kookie<br /> ı love you BTS[turkish fans]

Edit 5: ARMY, please go and rest. We have all worked so hard. Thank you for your effort. <br /><br />Everyone, please, let’s ignore all these bots. Let’s focus on the mv instead. It’s a beautiful and catchy song. So, let’s have fun!!! Army Fighting!!!! &lt;3<br /><br />Edit: ( 10 minutes before the first 24 hours) We have reached 97.5 million v1ews!! Good job ARMY!!!!<br /><br /><br />Edit 2: Dear ARMYs!!! After hours and hours of streaming, these are what I believe to be the results for the first 24 hours: <br /><br />98.7 million v1ews. ( new record)<br />8.8 million l1kes( new record) <br />10 million v1ews in the first 20 minutes ( new record) <br /><br />I will write more information when I see anything that I missed. Good job ARMY!!!!<br /><br />Edit 3: Yes, we did in fact broke the record for the most viewed mv in the first 24 hours!!! Maybe it wasn’t our goal but we still had a great time!! Thank you ARMY for streaming and giving your effort!!!! Take care beautiful humans!! I purple you all!!! <br /><br />Edit4: After 31 minutes after the first 24 hours, WE HAVE REACHED 100 million!!! ARMY, LETS CELEBRATE!! PLEASE, TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!!! WE DID IT!! BE HAPPY, BE PROUD!!<br /><br /><br />Edit6: We were at 131 million v1ews, now we are at 120million again. YouTube is deleting v1ews.<br /><br />Edit7: ( probably my last one) <br /><br />Bruh <br /><br /><br />Quarantine be hitting different with this bop-

Youtube might be rechecking the v13ws now so, make sure you stream using different IP addresses. <br /><br />Don&#39;t be alarmed if views suddenly slow down a lot, freeze or if there are deletions soon. Coming up within an hour or two is YT&#39;s &quot;v13w aud1t h0urs&quot;. Every day around 10-11pm kst, YT deletes v13ws from every video. On had deletions in the first 24h. May happen to Dynamite too. Don&#39;t forget str3am1ng like a human! (Cr charts_k &amp; sealien7) <br /><br />Edit : and we all see, we lost 3M. Keep str3m!! fighting!!<br />Edit2 : we need just go to minimize 90M and maksimal 100M V13ws in 24 hour&#39;s to break a record most of v13ws mv in 24 hours again!

#1 Trending in India. Dynamite is killing it.

I don’t how can people hate these person whose motive is just to make others HAPPY

We get it, you want your faves to be recognized but guess what. Hating on successful men is just as horrible as hating on successful women.

Este arte lo merecía todo..!

Look at how big BTS is, big and successful enough to trigger the antis. Are you that afraid of BTS?<br /><br />IT JUST PROVED AGAIN THAT WE ARE HIGHER THAN YOU. AND WE WILL FLY EVEN HIGHER TILL YOU CANT SEE US!!!!!!<br /><br />IT&#39;S BANGTAN STYLE<br /><br />now let&#39;s comment PROUD altogether

Come one ARMY we HAVE to get 100 MILLION IN 24 HOURS!!!!!!!<br />Edit: YES ARMY WE CAN DO IT LETS WORK HARD AND GET OUR BOYS TO 100 MILLION.<br />also I’m sorry for the Purple Heart, it totally slipped my mind but I deleted immediately :(((<br /><b>inserts 3 Purple Hearts</b><br />Re edit: so a few fellow ARMIES are coming at me for using “only” so I’ll like to say that I’m sorry if your offended, I said it in a supportive way and In a way to HYPE our dear ARMY Family and yes of course I know that BTS broke records after DYNAMITE. So I’m sorry if y’all are offended. :))<br /><b>Borahae ;)</b><br />RE RE EDIT: HAPPY 50 MILLION ARMY <b>HAPPY CRYING EMOJIS INSERTED</b><br />Edit: ARMY although it’s been 23 hours and we have 94 MILLION views, it’s ok.

&quot;Once your heart is moved, it will develop to something better and positive.&quot; - JIMIN

This boys are legends. This song is historical with or without that grammy award!

This is what a “GRAMMY WINNING SONG” sounds like.

Edit : GUYS its just my opinion plzz...  Don&#39;t take this seriously...<br />They are so cool......  I just can&#39;t stop listening, i don&#39;t understand why people don&#39;t like this masterpiece... Well i guess &quot;HATERS GONNA HATE&quot;

I haven&#39;t seen happiness like in Jin&#39;s eyes when he sings the last bit. His eyes are literally shining from joy

So....... this is the song of the year??..<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br /> Yes, yes it is.

We don&#39;t need anymore &quot;No one: Literally no one: &quot; comments.<br />Antis thanks for the lesson on this stre@ming game, I will work hard to support your favourite next time too :D<br /><br />Update, thank you antis..i guess  :))<br />*Fun Facts for Haters who are posting those &quot;noone comments&quot; <br />1. Those messages don&#39;t deleted views its a myth, it freezes the views 0.5 sec from showing in screen but the views are already registered in YT and will be uploaded shortly after freeze.<br />2. Those message will be considered as human behaviour not bot because bot don&#39;t comment. <br />3. Spamming like this will show that more people are interested in song so it will get to the trending.

i love the colour scheme of the mv a lot, makes you very happy

Badshah : I have record of most views in 24 hrs<br />BTS : hold our army

Popular opinion: everyone agrees that BTS doesn&#39;t need grammy&#39;s but grammy&#39;s need BTS

They make me smile like a fool, ajjda la neta me hago  la gringa :(

They mentioned micheal Jackson ablum there I’m proud of them

Just ignore the haters and keep your focus on the video!!! Lets goooo armyyyy lets do this!!!

I am so proud of these boys who can sing so very good in English!<br /><br />EDIT: Noway, this didn&#39;t happened, right? 60k likes. I am crying rn. Thank you so much ARMYs!!! Saranghae! Let&#39;s str34m!!! STAY SAFE!!!!

Even without a Grammy Dynamite is still a timeless BOP!

I can&#39;t find my bias now <br />Who am l ?

CAN’T STOP SMILING! this is such a feel good, upbeat, happy song! my serotonin levels are goin up! i’m in loveee

Unpopular opinion: BTS are the new big philosophers of our time. <br /><br />Ever wondered why they are suddenly everywhere? Why people are so obsessed with them? It&#39;s deeper than you think.<br />Disguised as a &quot;boy band&quot;, the true reason why they are so successful is because of how much they change people&#39;s life with their philosophy. They make people love themselves, and live happier lives. <br /><br />However, the world has yet to take them seriously, for the sole reason that they are... artists? Admired by mainly women? Asian? When literally philosophy emphasizes how important art is, and beauty, and good virtues. BTS are all of that. Talented, hard-working, big hearts, polite, make the world better with their messages, and by setting a good example. <br /><br />It&#39;s honestly tiring to have people underrate them all the time and mark them off as &quot;just a boy band with pretty boys&quot;. I can say with certainty that every fan, man or woman, uses them as an example for who they want to be, and how they want to be treated. Therefore, lots of fans have higher standards in love than most people can achieve, because lots of people don&#39;t have all the virtues that BTS has. People think their &quot;superficial beauty&quot; is why so many love them. No. It&#39;s everything they say and do that makes many admire them.<br /><br />Every song they write has a maze of different theories and meanings hidden inside them, and these songs get bundled into an album, like a philosopher bundles their work in a book. This is what many people don&#39;t understand. They even based some of their work on modern philosopher&#39;s books. They organized art exhibitions all over the world for small artists, and it has nothing to do with themselves. They just funded and organized the exhibition. Meaning that they put lots of effort into raising awareness for art and philosophy among (now) young people (but gradually also among older).<br /><br />This is also the reason why their fans try to spread their message and try to make everyone they know a fan. Because they know it will make anyone a better person, and eventually make the world a better place. I say this with all sincerity and passion.<br /><br />Like Plato once said, leaders of our world should be philosophers, and philosophers should be leaders.

Haters spamming comments <br />Also haters liking other spam comments

MUST READ!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />GUYS ITS NORMAL FOR THE MV TO SLOW DOWN OR FREEZE BECAUSE YT HAS TO IDENTIFY WETHER THE VIEWS ARE FROM REAL PEOPLE OR BOTS....PEOPLE WHO SPAM ARE NOT COUNTED FOR THE VIEW <br /><br />IF YOU WATCH THE WHOLE MV   IT WILL BE COUNTED AS A VIEW  ... IGNORE THE SPAM COMMENTS THERE RECEIVING WAY TO MUCH ATTENTION AND THATS WHAT THEY WANT!<br /><br />Views are not frozen  because of comments, emojis or specific words  YouTube freezes while checking if the views are real<br />If there are a lot of views it takes time <br /><br /><br /><br />JUST STREAM GUYS IGNORE THE SPAM SO THE VIEWS GO UP!!! DONT GIVE HATERS UNNECESSARY ATTENTION <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />SPREAD!!<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT1: sorry yall the 30 second thing wasn’t true I was confused because of what others were saying but it’s confirmed now you must watch the whole mv at 480p or above including any adverts that come with it without pressing skip add.<br /><br />EDIT2:guys I do think YouTube has deleted some views but it doesn’t matter we’re army were strong and we’re gonna do it  i just know it! FIGHTING<br /><br />EDIT3:LOL someone asked if I was the real Kim taehyung I’m not I wish I was LMAO <br />sorry if I disappointed you.<br /><br />EDIT4:You guys don’t need to censor any words and you can use emojis that was all a myth.<br /><br />EDIT5:DO NOT CLEAR YOUR HISTORY BECAUSE IT GETS RID OF YOUR VIEW IF YOU DO THAT<br /><br />EDIT6: IF YOU PAUSE YOUR HISTORY THE VIEWS DO NOT COUNT

BTS &amp;ARMY =FAM(ILY)<br />FAMILY HAS 3LETTERS THAT SAY:<br /><b>I LOVE YOU</b><br />~AZERBAIJANI ARMY FOREVER

Jungkook doesn&#39;t need to wear expensive clothing. . He&#39;s in himself a brand  😊

<b>That&#39;s because he is the Jeon Jungkook 💜</b>

He is a normal person with common sense 👍🙏.  Just because you have money doesn&#39;t mean you have to spend it, doesn&#39;t mean you have to have the most expensive things. His BTS clothes are very expensive, but JK is just a person who likes what he likes 💜🙏

Jungkook is the bunny with the biggest heart and the most beautiful soul!

BTS don&#39;t need to flaunt their wealth, they&#39;re so humble and never brags about their wealth, instead they always donate their money for a good cause.

He probably likes to be thrifty <br />Just so you know there&#39;s a difference between cheap and thrifty

<b><i>I think some people realize how much BTS means to me. They have taught me to love myself even when I hate everything a bout myself . Even when I&#39;m really depressed and nothing will make me happy, I watch a few videos a bout BTS and they make me smile instantly.</i></b><br /><b>WE PURPLE YOU, BTS</b>

Jungkook has a great image. He can wear whatever he wants and always look attractive, in a casual outfit or designer. He likes the laid back kinda style &amp; he will always wear clothes that he feels most comfortable in

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUEdy97eBu4&amp;t=1m59s">1:59</a> The face of a baby but the body of a man !

Jungkook: <b>drinks lemon kombucha</b><br /><del>Two Days Later</del><br />Twitter: Lemon Kombucha in Korea has risen sales by 300%<br /><del>One Week Later</del><br />Jungkook: ARMY, I can&#39;t even buy 2 packs of kombucha anymore...

Jungkook is like small body but have big and golden heart

He is not a fasionista he is a normal person but even if he wears a cheap cloth it will sold out that&#39;s the power of him 🔥

Even if he is rich doesn’t mean he has to wear expensive clothes

&quot;I&#39;m ok because I&#39;m JK&quot;<br />                                     -Jeon Jungkook<br />💜💜💜

Popular opinion: Jungkook didn&#39;t let money change his life.

The real question is how they look so good in it.

I believe RM often buys things second hand.  Like Suga said, you need to see the ground to know you&#39;re flying.  Buying more affordable or second hand clothes is a way to stay grounded.  So many celebrities wind up bankrupt because they get used to a fancy lifestyle and become careless with their money.

Indeed Jungkook has a really big heart🐰💜💜

He is such a sensible young man who needs those expensive clothing they are just totally over priced.

OMG HI! It&#39;s really thoughtful of Jungkook to help others! he really has a big heart💜

Besides that&#39;s it&#39;s afordable to us if ever we wanted to buy the same clothes that he had.<br />He has a great impact and help those  product/Brand that is unknown to us to be more exposed and known to the business world thanks to Jungkook..

It&#39;s beautiful if bts members wear high end brands of clothes or just simple and cheap its still fit them and they&#39;d still handsome if they wear any clothes....

Jungkook and BTS members are normal people(with a pure heart💖).... The only difference is that they have money but dont spend it on stuff they don&#39;t need!😊😙💕

The answer is, You don’t have to wear expensive clothes to look good.

Very relatable kookie

When I tell my mom about jungkook&#39;s broken taped phone <br />She said : <b>&quot; people who have did a alot of Hard-work and has accomplished success will never spend their money on useless things because they know how they have earned this and how important money is unlike those ppl who just spend their parents money and feel rich&quot;</b>

Boy knows he could look like a king in just a burlap sack so why stress? Just wear what you want!

Jk is a very good guy ..we can see at his face he is very kind person..love kk ..love all the members of BTS..

Relatable :&gt;

If I wear cheap clothes my friends trolling me for no reason🙄😂but don&#39;t worry I never mind their words...cuz in reality I&#39;m middle class and I can&#39;t buy expensive things...and yeah thanx to jk I can wear clothes that jungkook prefers😁👍

Jungkook is a very sweet person i think he tries to save money...but he still looks so cute like a bunny in cheap clothes though and will always....💜🐇

Because he is telented and handsome so, he doesn&#39;t need expensive clothes .he always look beautiful and handsome with any clothes 🥰

He is in himself a brand💜 then what are you talking about?

Jungkook you were 18 (mine age right now haha), when I had a crush on you after seeing your picture . I was not even Army at that time. But I literally saw you growing. I was very young but you made me smile and cry with you. Bcz of you I became an Army and ot7. So I am literally very proud of you. At this young age you are very humble and kind. I don&#39;t know what we do to deserve you but I know I can never have a person like you in my life so I tried very hard to become a person like you for someone else. Kind, sweetest, hardworking and purest like you. You taught me soo much. I have a massive respect for you. You have more positive influence than young bloggers and youtubers these days. And no matter how much I will grow, a part of my heart always belongs to you. Thanks for existing❤💜

Jungkook doesn&#39;t cares about Brand and why would he? Afterall whatever he wears becomes brand 😌🤞🤞💜💜

YouTube is fine cause there’s 0 views 7 likes and 1 comment :D

Armys bunny and kookie has a kind sweet and heart💜🔮💜🔮

Expensive things don&#39;t always last long because its kinda difficult to keep them safe and clean but cheap things can throw all over and it will be fine , just give it a wash lol . My cheap clothes lasts about 20 years and my expensive about 4 years 👀💀

Hi I’m your 282th view....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ofc no one would like this cause I didn’t say anything interesting......

He has great personality. He is so helpful and humble.

THAT IS SOOO WHOLESOME LIKE 😌😌😌💜💜💜<br /><br /><br /><br />PS:JIMIN LITERALLY BUYS CLOTHES FROM THE CORNER STORE LIKE.....😌💜😌💜😌

There should be more people like Jungkook in this world!

Jungkook don&#39;t need expensive brands to stand out whatever he wears becomes brand...he ua a sold out king

Cause underneath all that fame and good looks. He&#39;s just like us. The rest of the BTS members are rich now they could have hired ppl to get the stuff that they need but they chose to do it themselves. Even when they know there some crazy people out there that could harm them.

Omggg I can’t with this human! I love him and how kind he is! I also love him for having such a big heart and thinks of other’s and helps them!💜

LOVE IT!!!!! HE HAS A HUMBLE CARING LOVING AND A GENEROSITY PERSONALITY, AS AN ARTIST AND GREAT INFLUECIER, LOVE  HIS ACTIONS WHICH IMPACTS MANY PEOPLES TO AROUND THE WORLD TO CHANGE AND MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE. LOVE YOU

So what I do too I bet a few people do it SO WHAT I know I need to chill but don’t talk about any members like that because that’s mean and disrespectful just because he’s a star or whatever doesn’t mean they wear clothes that costs 150,000 uhm pardon me they can be who they want even if they’re poor

I&#39;m so happy that he chose to wear normal affordable clothes. He&#39;s such a great influence on people of all ages 💜

I love Jungkook cheap style. That’s why I like to buy not expensive brands I like buy clothes that aren’t too expensive. Jungkook I love your style. 💜🥰

Jungkook is so precious <br />He is the perfect role model

Excuse me i am offened an as a army and I should be.Jungkook is a normal person and has the right to do that he want.They post their picture but saying that he wears cheaps stuff is entering into his personal life .So stay it better to stay out of it.Respect his life decisions.

Imagine paying like $40 for a white shirt when you can get the same one for like $8.

Jk really humble which makes him so great <br />Borahae

Even though he buys cheap clothes and wear still he looks handsome and our cute little bunny forever🐰😍🥰💜<br />Who agrees with me <br />⬇️

Because he has something called<br /><b>COMMON SENSE</b>

Sure, but also he doesn’t seem to care, all his style is very casual and black.

Aww he is so kind :&gt; I personally like cheap clothes more then expensive ones,  I just think they look better like what&#39;s so special about Gucci. I think it&#39;s ugly 🙄

Uhm does it matter what clothes he buys..? So what if he buys cheap let kookie do his thing.

WDYM!? Cheap clothes are comfy and AFFORDABLE!!! Lollllll! 💜💜💜💜

I don&#39;t get it why should we care on what he is wearing it&#39;s his choice anyway

He is the most hume, kind, considerate and caring person!! I am glad to stan him!!!😍😍😍

firstly they don&#39;t show off by wearing gucci or any other brand their themselves a brand. and don;t even showoff by wearing all this shit

He doesn&#39;t need to wear expensive clothes he is still high class

He is the person who has pure soul<br />That&#39;s why he is my bias ❤️

Really, Jungkook?<br />He&#39;s so thoughtful.

Jungkook has a really big heart even though he has a lot of money . he follow his own. Actually jungkook fashion is the best fashion boy in the world . <br /><br />thanks to jungkook i be able to smile forever

That&#39;s the reason why he&#39;s my ultimate bias💜

And that&#39;s why i love them , they are so humble .They deserve more and more

I like jungkook clothes and he&#39;s style of whering cloths hi look so cool and comfortably handsome whatever he where I loved it

Because the expensive ones didn&#39;t always feels comfortable.

Someone:- perfect people are found only in books and movies <br />Me:-  (*shows BTS*)      do you know BTS?

Look at how just buying clothes for yourself helps people out !  Really JUNGKOOK has a white soul like REALLY !!

He looks good in everithing!😄

Can we remember and talk how he still uses the shirt Whoopi Goldberg gift him?

EARLY AND THE 25TH COMMENT WHO LOVES BTS<br />👇🏻

I&#39;m not in love with wrong man and I&#39;ve huge respect for him from bottom of my heart&#39;s I really respect him and BTS how they use their influence to help others instead of using costly luxury brand they use normal clothes from online shop to promote small businesses ☺️but no matter what I&#39;ll follow them till my last breath 🥰

cuz he knows he will look good in any clothes. Doesn&#39;t have to be expensive 😌

Jungkook owns (having )a Rare Black card...Search on Google can&#39;t tell u here!!!💜💜💜

Yes, No need to buy very expensive clothes, shoes and etc, Use money to do good deeds. You give and you receive.

Am I the only one who thinks that a lot of designer clothes are looking not good on anybody?

Why spend all that money on clothes that&#39;s only a fad and you make the clothes not the other way around

That’s why many army’s love him bc of his big heart🥺💜💜

Wow! Jungkook: you are priceless.  BTS good deeds are rewarded.  I will continue success for you guys.  I Love You BTS

could someone pls tell me or explain me how do bighit chooses or selects their staffs camera man and makeup artist..............<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />no one🤨🤔

Hlo everyone 💜

The reason made me emotional 😭 <br />How can bts be so so kind <br />I wish bts haters, my non kpop friends and my mom knows this side of them

He buys cheap clothes because he wants to keep both his kidneys (just kidding)🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

He doesn&#39;t need brands🔥<br /><br />Brands need him 😉

It  was so good to hear this and rare in the region they are from , when we went to Japan , china , Korea the queues outside designer stores where massive , they have a big interest in brand names unlike the uk . We do need to buy responsibility now and help struggling local businesses after covid and they have a great platform to do this , well done kookie !!!

When consumers buys clothes, the expensive price tags doesn&#39;t always means comfort, lasting durability and quality. When you&#39;re buying branded pieces, you&#39;re buying the brand. As long as he&#39;s comfortable wearing what he wears then I don&#39;t really mind how much he spends. He&#39;s a mature 23 years old global superstar who is humble despite being famous, he can definitely manage his own finance.

<b>I&#39;m proud of you, BTS. With or without a GRAMMY, just keep doing what you guys do best, you living legends!</b> 💜

ARMY, there are &#39;devils&#39; out there spreading hatred and trying to make real ARMY angry.. beware and don&#39;t get drawn into an argument.. let&#39;s remind one another and spread BTS love instead.<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23LoveYourself">#LoveYourself</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23LoveBTS">#LoveBTS</a><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23LoveARMY">#LoveARMY</a><br /><br />Edit: sorry for being 5 months late. For those who demand that I remove the purple heart, next time learn to ask nicely. How you comment reflects on ARMY as a whole.<br />FYI, emojis do not freeze views. Please learn to do research online to find the truth than to hear-say and insist you are right. Get yourselves educated in terms of knowledge and character.<br />Last but not least, I am not removing the purple heart. Love me or hate me, I am still me 😉<br /><br />2nd edit: Read 140+ comments in this thread. Decide to cut some slack and remove the purple heart because Crackhead Culture uses the word &#39;please&#39;.
